# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Showroom Auto Philly

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website for a car detailer shop that will let you see reviews, description of the place, goals, etc. Will also allow you to go to social media pages such as Instagram and TikTok and also allow for a place to reserve an appointment.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will allow people to see reviews and mission board of my cousin's car detailing shop. It will have a way of letting you go to social media pages such as Instagram and TikTok through the webpage. There will also be a button that will take you to a form that you can fill out to book an appointment. It will be made through HTML and CSS.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will establish a working website without the buttons.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to get all of the buttons working and also linking everything properly.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To get everything working as I have planned so it can be used.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to relearn HTML/CSS which I had exposure to when I was in high school. I haven't programmed a page in a while so I will most likely need to freshen up my memory. I will begin with making a basic HTML page first such as printing the words and such on it. Then I will make a CSS file to edit the words on the page. In the end, I will try to upload pictures and links to social media pages and such.
